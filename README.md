A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite VR](https://resonite.com/) that allows for the customization of InteractionLasers and your Cursor.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. VERIFY [ResoniteModSettings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/ResoniteModSettings) is up to date. (This is very important)
3. Place [LaserRecolorJank.dll](https://github.com/Ap6661/LaserRecolorJank/releases/latest/download/LaserRecolorJank.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\ResoniteVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
